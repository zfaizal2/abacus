</h3>
I hate using spreadsheets to keep track of my grades throughout the semester. I also have to calculate my GPA every time I make an estimate. Hopefully this can solve that. Built using Next.js, Express/Node.js, and MongoDB. 

## Getting started
<br/>

To the backend running, execute the following commaznd in the /backend directory.
```
nodemon server
```
To get the frontend running, execute the following in /frontend.
```
npm run dev
```

You can access the UI at `localhost:3000` and the backend is hosted on `localhost:8000`
